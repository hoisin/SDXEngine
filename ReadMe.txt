UnitTests proj
--------------

Due to the stupid long ass directory name to google test's lib files, git hub doesn't detect them as changes so cannot upload.


Therefore the following NuGet package needs to be re-installed manually in visual studio when code has been checked out:
Microsoft.googletest.v140.windesktop.msvcstl.static.rt-dyn
